 graphql
 graphql has one end point only 
 with graphql apis you can easly grap the data you need.
 you can featch the field we need only.
 The big differences is the way we send the request.
 it works with post/
 It define in the app.js the connection, the schma, 
 how to check car{
          (id="23")
          {
          name
          } 
          ths give us Honda the car under number 23.
 }
